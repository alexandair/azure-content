# Azure Automation scenario - automate removal of resource groups

Many customers create more than one resource group, where some are dedicated for managing production applications and others may be development, testing, and staging environments. Automating the deployment of these resources is one thing, but being able to decommission a resource group with a click of the button is another. Using Automation to handle it is a perfect use case and opportunity to streamline such a common management task. This also becomes helpful if you are working with an Azure subscription that has a spending limit through a member offer like MSDN or the Microsoft Partner Network Cloud Essentials program, for example. 

This scenario is based on a PowerShell runbook and is designed to remove one or more resource groups that you specify from your subscription. The runbook supports testing first before proceeding, which is its default value. This way you don't accidentally delete it without making absolutely sure you are ready to complete this procedure.   

## Getting the scenario

This scenario consists of a PowerShell runbook that you can download from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Remove-ResourceGroup/1.0/DisplayScript).<br>   

Runbook | Description|
----------|------------|
Remove-ResourceGroup | Removes one or more Azure resource groups and its resources from the subscription.  
<br>
The following input parameters are defined for this runbook:

Parameter | Description|
----------|------------|
AuthenticationAssetName (Optional) | The name of an authentication asset with authorization for this subscription.|
NameFilter (Required) | Allows you to specify a name filter to limit the resource groups that you intend on deleting. You can pass multiple values using a comma-separated list.<br>
The filter is not case sensitive and will match any resource group that contains the string.|
PreviewMode (Optional) with default of $true | Execute the runbook to see which resource groups would be deleted but take no action.

## Installing and configuring this scenario

### Prerequisites

The runbook works with an [Azure Run As account](automation-sec-configure-azure-runas-account.md). The Run As account is the preferred authentication method since it uses certificate authentication instead of a password that may expire or change frequently.  

### Install and publish the runbooks

After downloading the runbook, you can import it using the procedure in [Importing runbook procedures](automation-creating-importing-runbook.md#importing-a-runbook-from-a-file-into-Azure-Automation). Publish the runbook after it has been successfully imported into your Automation account.


## Using the runbook

The following steps will walk you through the execution of this runbook and help you become familiar with how it works. We will only be testing the runbook in this example, not actually deleting the resource group.  

1. From the Azure Portal, open your Automation account and click the **Runbooks** tile.
2. Select the **Remove-ResourceGroup** runbook and click **Start**.
3. When you start the runbook, the **Start Runbook** blade opens and you can configure the following values for the parameters.  Select a resource group in your subscription that you want to test with and will cause no harm if you accidentally delete it.<br> ![Remove-ResouceGroup Parameters](media/automation-scenario-remove-resourcegroup/remove-resourcegroup-input-parameters.png)
    
    >[AZURE.NOTE] Make sure the **Previewmode** option is set to **true** in order to avoid deleting the selected resource group(s).  **Please note** that this runbook will not allow you to delete the resource group that the Automation account is defined in.  

4. Once you have configured all the parameter values, click **OK** and the runbook will be queued up for execution.  

To view the details of the **Remove-ResourceGroup** runbook job in the Azure portal, select the **Jobs** tile of the runbook. The job summary displays the input parameters and the output stream, in addition to general information about the job and any exceptions if they occurred.<br> ![Remove-ResourceGroup Runbook Job Status](media/automation-scenario-remove-resourcegroup/remove-resourcegroup-runbook-job-status.png).

The **Job Summary** includes messages from the output, warning, and error streams. Select the **Output** tile to view detailed results from the runbook execution.<br> ![Remove-ResourceGroup Runbook Output Results](media/automation-scenario-remove-resourcegroup/remove-resourcegroup-runbook-job-output.png)
